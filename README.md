js-jira-sortable-subtasks
=========================

JavaScript tools for sorting subtasks by drag 'n drop in JIRA.

## Installation (bookmarklet)
If you don't have control of the JIRA instance you can still use drag and drop by creating a bookmark in your browser and copying the contents (from line 2) of bookmarklet.txt into the URL portion of it.

## Installation (JIRA server)
Add sortable-subtasks.js to the viewissue.jsp file in JIRA.
